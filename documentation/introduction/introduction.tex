\chapter{Introduction}

\section{What is Dynaflow-launcher?}

\textbf{Dynaflow-launcher is a utility tool used to easily run \href{https://dynawo.github.io/about/dynaflow}{\underline{Dynaflow}}
starting from a minimal set of inputs.} \\

It provides the following possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Unitary simulations}: computation of the steady-state solution on a given network (IIDM format) with Dynaflow;
  \item \textbf{Systematic analysis}: assessment of the stability of a single base network subject to different events;
\end{itemize}

Dynaflow-launcher is licensed under the terms of the \href{http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0}{\underline{Mozilla Public License, v2.0}}.
The source code is hosted into a \href{https://github.com/dynawo/dynaflow-launcher} {\underline{GitHub repository}}. \\

\section{Changes from previous versions}

\subsection{Changes from v1.4.0}

\underline{New features:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Improved modeling of Hvdcs
\item Added the possibility to model secondary voltage controls
\item Added the NSA flow that allows to launch first a N and then a systematic analysis based on the N outputs
\item Added an option to select between warm and flat initialization
\item Added an option to model transformers within generators models when voltage is above a threshold
\end{itemize}

\underline{Performance:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Improved solver default configuration
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Changes from v1.3.1}

\underline{Main changes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Creation of a result file
\item Improvements of solver and jobs configuration for performance
\item default event time is now set at 10s
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Changes from v1.3.0}
First release.
