# Dynaflow-launcher - Documentation

This directory contains LaTeX sources for Dynaflow-launcher documentation.

You can download Dynaflow-launcher documentation [here](https://github.com/dynawo/dynaflow-launcher/releases/download/v1.4.0/DynaflowLauncherDocumentation.pdf).

Scripts:
* **compile.sh**: compile each separated LaTex document (except the licenses).
* **dynaflow_launcher_documentation.sh**: merge all LaTex files to create the complete Dynaflow-launcher documentation.
* **clean.sh**: remove all latex temporary files and pdf.

For the moment those scripts should be launched from this directory to work properly.
